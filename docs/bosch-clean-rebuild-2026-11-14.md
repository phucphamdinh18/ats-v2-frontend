# Bosch V2 clean rebuild — implementation log

Date: 2026-11-14
Scope: PR #44 only. No Supabase schema, Edge Function, Auth, RLS, production site, or recruitment workflow changes.

## Recovery point
- Branch: `backup/bosch-pr44-before-clean-rebuild-20261114`
- SHA: `938dc56382d5d48b6203786a437b20c496409873`
- Retained independently from the active draft PR. Never force-push/delete it.

## Completed in this first implementation slice
- New `web/components/bosch-v2-jobs.module.css`: standalone Bosch V2 styling for Jobs Master.
- Refactored `web/components/bosch-jobs-master.tsx` to use only its CSS module for screen-level selectors; preserved existing Jobs props, filtering, selection, Pipeline open actions and real API metrics.
- New `web/components/bosch-v2-job-detail.module.css`: standalone job header, tabs, metadata, details and auxiliary sections.
- Refactored `web/components/bosch-job-detail.tsx` to use scoped CSS Module classes instead of `.bosch-*` global CSS.
- `ApplicationPipeline` remains mounted unchanged and retains the existing stage/API/permission handling.

## Still open — NOT production ready
1. Extract Auth/session/access refresh logic from `workspace.tsx` into a tested headless adapter/hook without breaking RLS-driven access.
2. Replace the legacy `.shell` App Shell with a dedicated layout and remove old `globals.css` visual dependencies; verify Bosch wordmark no longer clips.
3. Rebuild pipeline's internal tables, five-stage summary and candidate side panel with the same isolated visual architecture. No invented data.
4. Complete visual QA at the user's reference viewport, Admin/TA/HM/Interviewer E2E and inspect real API errors and empty states.
5. Migrate Candidates, Interviews and Offers only after Jobs is accepted.
6. Delete legacy UI only when no imports/references remain. Preserve backup and all rollback paths.

## Verify / rollback
- CI checks: QA, Next web checks, Publish ATS Pages PR-build. `Supabase local browser E2E` can be skipped without a Docker-enabled runner: record as unverified.
- Live preview is not automatically updated by PR commits. `Publish ATS Pages` manual `path-preview` requires live verification of root `release.json` before choosing `production_ref`.
- Rollback by resetting the PR branch to the backup SHA in a controlled new commit/branch or comparing and restoring individual files; never rewrite production history.
- Do not merge or delete backup before owner acceptance.

## Step 2 — App Shell visual separation (2026-11-14)
- Created `web/components/bosch-v2-shell.module.css` for the Bosch header/identity/sidebar/top navigation/search/account layout.
- Replaced the legacy `shell/sidebar/topbar` DOM class contract in `web/components/workspace.tsx` with CSS Module classes; preserved existing onClick handlers and state for role-filtered nav, job search, Ctrl/Cmd+K, language selection, guide, session logout and job selection.
- This removes the old `.shell` styles from the App Shell. **Existing Pipeline and other modules may still depend on `.shell` descendant overrides and require visual/regression checks.**
- This is *presentational decoupling*, NOT yet full extraction of Auth/session/access logic into a headless controller. Auth remains in `workspace.tsx` and is deliberately unchanged for safety.
- Pending: test browser screenshots, extract Auth/access logic, migrate Pipeline internals; do not claim full frontend replacement.

## Step 3 — Job Pipeline presentation extraction (2026-11-14)
- Added `web/components/bosch-v2-pipeline.module.css` with isolated five-stage summary, list table, status labels, right-side candidate overview/detail, timeline and responsive layout.
- Refactored `web/components/application-pipeline.tsx` to use the new scoped CSS classes for the summary/list/detail. No modifications to `listApplications`, `searchApplications`, `applicationDetail`, stage transitions, idempotent `request_id`, role checks or candidate selection lifecycle.
- Preserved Kanban view and manual candidate form under existing implementations to avoid destabilizing stage drag/drop or create-candidate behavior. These are **still legacy presentation dependencies** and MUST be migrated in a separate tested step; the frontend is not yet isolated end-to-end.
- Display continues to show `—` for matching/experience/interview-round/last activity where the API does not return values; do not invent user data.
- No manual `path-preview` dispatch, no changes to root release, no live visual QA, no E2E certification in this step.
- Next: isolate Kanban and candidate intake UI; validate screenshot and actual role-scoped behavior before considering legacy CSS deletion.
